# DocumentPersistentFragment

- - -

## ⚠️ Deprecated

Current [discussion](https://github.com/whatwg/dom/issues/736#issuecomment-2764636514) is pivoting toward this [GroupNodes](https://github.com/WebReflection/group-nodes#readme) variant/alternative which looks and feels way easier to reason about and implement, it's just a "*special fragment*" weakly bound to its surrounding comments.

- - -

Currently a polyfill for the [WHATWG proposal](https://github.com/whatwg/dom/issues/736).

[Live test](https://webreflection.github.io/document-persistent-fragment/) with 100% code coverage and a global `dpf` usable at the end of the test.

### Warning

This is most likely going to change, don't use this in prod.
